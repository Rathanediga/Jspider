    <span>Computer Vision Technology has played a significant role in assisting visually challenged people to carry out their day to day activities without much dependency on other people.</span>
    <span>Smart glasses in one such solution which enables blind or visually challenged people to “read” images. In this project we design the smart glasses using deep learning and ultrasonic sensors. The model basically consists of a camera, ultrasonic sensor, processing unit and the output device consists of a speaker. The ultrasonic sensors calculate the distance between the user and the obstacle and then informs the dangerous level by sound. We use YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) one of the deep learning algorithms, to inform the type of obstacle and the objects to be found to the user. These glasses could easily guide the blind people and help them avoid obstacles, and used to detect the objects, persons, doors, windows and chairs etc. to helps the blinds in their daily activities to avoid the dependency on others.</span>
